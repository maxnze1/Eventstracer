            "body": "<p>The 2019 edition of GTBank Food &amp; Drink Festival was more than just a gathering of food enthusiasts; it seemed like the much needed platform where small businesses were given an opportunity to showcase their products to thousands of visitors. The organizers delivered on their promise to promote SMEs by connecting them with consumers and business experts from around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the vendors that participated in the just concluded 4th edition of GT Bank Food and Drink festival which ran from 28th April to 1st May 2019, they wished the exhibition and sales could go on, despite this year&rsquo;s extended edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bimbo Balogun of Homemade Cashew Nuts who participated in the Fair for the first time said that as a Vendor, she did not pay anything to the bank in order to exhibit at the fair. When questioned by our correspondent on how she was shortlisted, she explained that she applied on time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balogun went on to express her gratitude to the organizers; she said that within the two days she was allowed to exhibit, she recorded a lot of sales and established contacts. &ldquo;In fact there is no platform as good as this&rdquo; she added. Another excited participant who preferred to remain anonymous described the event as &ldquo;the bomb&rdquo;. He went on to state that &ldquo;there is no platform for SMEs like this one&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual food and drinks fair which took place at the GT Event Centre located at Plot 1, Water Corporation Drive, Victoria Island, Lagos was the confluence of food enthusiasts, retailers, Chefs and food experts under one roof. Due to the organizers&rsquo; desire to accommodate more businesses and better manage the event, the three hundred (300) selected vendors were split into two groups that participated for only two days each out of the four days of the fair. Yet, this arrangement was unable to satisfy the demand for SMEs exhibition at the fair. In fact, some of those who were not selected by the organizers stood undeterred at various corners of the GT Event Centre to hand their business flyers to roaming visitors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, enticing food aromas, the sporadic appearance of celebrities and the humming buzz of popular music in the background created an exciting atmosphere as visitors feasted their eyes and stomach&rsquo;s to mouth-watering cuisines and confectionaries artistically displayed by food and drink vendors in their various stalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, there was farmers&rsquo; market for the sale of fresh and organic produce as well as a showcase of some of the finest street food. The children were not left out as the organizers already had in place, a protected section with games and fun exercises for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year&rsquo;s event had 15 international renowned Chefs who facilitated the culinary master classes. They educated the small business owners on business secrets such as; secrets to building and maintaining a world class restaurant, food styling for photography amongst others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 4-day Fair ended on a high note when Ton Tasanakajohn ended his masterclass with a resounding &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; in Yoruba and received three Nigerian names from the excited audience.&nbsp;</p>",

            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first edition of the Tourism and Technology Summit was held at the prestigious Oriental Hotel in Victoria Island, Lagos, on the 30th of May, 2019.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe event which was themed &ldquo;Building a new ecosystem for tourism in Africa, innovation, disruption and technology&rdquo; had in attendance hundreds of people and organizations with keen interest in the sector. Also in attendance, were some big names in the information technology and Tourism sectors like Jumia Travels, VR 360 Stories, Netcore Solutions, EMR Emergency Services, Isaac &amp; Nneka Moses of Goge Africa and Pazino Homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The power couple, Isaac and Nneka Moses of popular TV progrogramme, Goge Africa, who spoke at the event on how culture integrates technology and how it can drive tourism said that tourism is a product of culture because people travel to different destinations just to experience cultures that they are not familiar with. They further encouraged the audience to preserve and promote indigenous Nigerian culture so that foreigners can travel down to experience it. The couple highlighted that, the use of technology makes it easy to bundle this cultural information and sell it to the world. &ldquo;Culture is the oil that drives Tourism. It increases the attractiveness of a destination, stimulates employment and kick starts the economic activities of a place.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sam Adeleke, co &ndash; founder of Travelcentre.africa who also spoke at the event said, technology is the catalyst that will transform travel and tourism in Africa. He cited Google as an example technology incorporates any information a traveler might need on a trip in order to deliver a complete travel experience to them. He stated that &ldquo;Google travels could become the number one digital travel agency in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In an interview Uri Ngozi Chukwuka of April, Benjamin &amp; Don Consultants, who was the media consultant of the summit, said technology has brought disruption to the tourism sector and if harnessed properly, it could be a means to harvest the great potentials of the sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Speaking on how technology can be used to improve Tourism, Nneka Moses of Goge Africa said, technology won&rsquo;t fix the deteriorating tourism sites in Nigeria but if the government can create an enabling environment it becomes easy to promote tourism and generate revenue from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Clara Chinwe Okoro, the Founder/COO of Brandworld Media and organizer of the summit said that the aim of the event was to bring together experts in IT Industry and Tourism/Travel industry to exchange ideas on how to use technology to solve problems facing the Tourism sector. She said that untapped resources abound in this part of the world so, &ldquo;one could develop an app or software that would solve a problem that has been around for years.&rdquo; She further disclosed that the plan was to make the summit an annual event where new tourism-related technologies would be reviewed and measured against its ability to cut operational costs and improve profit.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",

            "title": "\u201cYou Can\u2019t Win A Fight With Your Boss\u201d By Tom Markert",
            "slug": "you-cant-win-a-fight-with-your-boss-by-tom-markert",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Actually, using &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t Win A Fight With Your Boss&rdquo; as the title of this book is somewhat misleading because the book is a collection of fifty five other rules for success at work. However, this particular rule &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t Win A Fight With Your Boss&rdquo; for good reason stands out and probably explains why it is regarded as the book&rsquo;s title. All the same hardly anyone who has ever had a boss will argue about the merits of it being an appropriate title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perhaps Tom Market may have originally directed the book&rsquo;s content at readers who already have jobs but frankly the book should be mandatory reading for anyone looking for or about to start a job for the first time. The reason is that as many workers have found out later than they would have wanted, you can&rsquo;t actually win a fight with your boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The advice dispensed by the book may seem commonsense like but in practice they are not because in the heat of work when emotions, ego and perceived expertise all mix together, there is a tendency to forget who is the boss and therefore fall into the temptation, sometimes at great cost to your career, of trying to prove a point to your boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It seems strange that despite leading the book with this kind of title, Tom Markert waited twenty-one pages before introducing it as one of the rules of success. The rule is in fact tucked away as Rule 9. When he eventually introduces it, he very quickly and rightly too, points out that &ldquo;a very quick way to destroy your career is to pick a fight with your boss.&rdquo; To avoid falling prey to this potentially career ending pitfall, the author introduces a rather interesting term &ldquo;emotional elasticity&rdquo; and advises that every worker should learn what the emotional elasticity of their boss is. This is defined as how far you can stretch your boss before a snap occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The book contains several other rules for success and what makes them really appealing is that they transcend time, are actually applicable throughout a person&rsquo;s career and need not be applied in any particular order. You can pick and apply any rule at any time or stage of your career. Some of the other rules in the book include learn how to write, work hard and smart, no one is entitled to anything, put in the hours and listen for what you don&rsquo;t hear. While reading the book you are likely to forget previous rules as you get further into the book but you don&rsquo;t experience any loss in continuity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Written and packaged somewhat like a pocket book, it is a thoroughly readable book and has good pace about it. A major plus for the book is its simple language which probably comes from the fact that it is not a strategy book, so all the usually complicated stuff about business has is not in it. You are tempted often, to keep reading and try to get to the end of the book but being a kind of rules book, that soon proves not possible or indeed practicable. You can however skip reading some rules and go directly to those that either reflect mistakes you have made in the past in your career, simply apply to your present situation at work or your present relationship with your boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Two words most commonly associated with work are hard and smart and it seems logical that they should be linked with having a successful relationship with your boss. Not unreasonably Tom Market makes working hard and smart the first rule in the book. And as if for emphasis, he writes that it is the corner stone of the book. If you don&rsquo;t perform, you can&rsquo;t keep your job! It&rsquo;s a breezy book that prompts you to reflect about, reinforce or rebuild your attitude to your work and may well help you improve your performance and results.</p>",

            "slug": "the-ten-commandments-for-business-failure-by-donald-r-keough",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Yes of course, &ldquo;The Ten Commandments For Business Failure&rdquo; is an innovative title for any book and for that reason a alone you should get a copy and read it. Or should you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Donald Keough, on the strength of his corporate experience especially in one of the most iconic global companies and brands, Coca-Cola, is sufficiently expert enough to be listened to when he talks about the things that make for business failure. And that is exactly what he has done in his book &ldquo;The Ten Commandments For Business Failure&rdquo;. A lot of books on strategy often have the word success implied about them but by going with the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; the author has made his book more intriguing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In some way, the book&rsquo;s title seems to distract from the seriousness of what it discusses, the real-life challenge of avoiding business failure. Make no mistake about it, this is a serious book, written for anyone in business who is intent on staying in the game successfully and for a long while too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For starters Mr. Keough asserts correctly that &ldquo;companies are artificial constructs.&rdquo; &ldquo;A company doesn&rsquo;t fail to do anything. Individuals do, and when you probe a bit you usually find that failure lies not in a litany of strategic mistakes &ndash; though they may be present in one form or another &ndash; but the real fault lies, as Shakespeare noted, in ourselves, the leaders of the business.&rdquo;&nbsp; Businesses he says, &ldquo;are the product and extension of the personal characteristics of its leaders. The lengthened shadows of the men and women who run them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Cleverly hidden in each commandment is a piece of strategic advice written as a chapter of the book and backed up with ample real-life stories about companies, the management and managers of these companies. What will a manager not give to know the secrets of failure? Through the ages several authors have tried to explain what makes one business to succeed or fail over another and this is unlikely to stop. This book &ldquo;The Ten Commandments For Business Failure&rdquo; is no different. But it is much more than an addition to the library of business books. It offers real insight into &ldquo;business failure&rdquo; and therein lies its uniqueness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Some of the commandments of business failure in the book include; quit taking risks, isolate yourself, don&rsquo;t take time to think, send mixed messages and be afraid of the future. Of the commandments, it is actually the first commandment, &ldquo;quit taking risks&rdquo; that defines the book. To have a business, any business at all, requires taking risks. So, business failure itself already assumes that you do have a business at hand and therefore you have taken a risk. This quotation in the book from Peter Drucker, the management sage, sums this all up, &ldquo;it is management&rsquo;s major task to prudently risk a company&rsquo;s present assets in order to ensure its future existence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From several examples it looks as though that the book is steeped in Coca-Cola history, where Mr. Keough worked successfully as a top-level executive for several decades. But the company of persons he kept and still keeps today suggests that it is more than the sum of his journey in Coca-Cola journey. Even if it were, a life time experience in a global company such as Coca-Cola is sufficient to write a good business book about failure. His interactions with some of the world&rsquo;s best business people Warren Buffet (who wrote the forward), Rupert Murdoch, Bill Gates, Jack Welch and others also helped shape the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is a business book with reality. Very significantly its goal is not to keep you from failing. Rather, it helps you realise the need to understand why you failed and how to find the possible success intrinsic within that failure. As Mr. Keough himself summarises, it&rsquo;s not the failure that matters but finding the way to pick yourself up and move on. That, supposedly is the moral of this book.</p>",

            "slug": "talent-is-overrated-by-geoff-colvin",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Is there a correlation between talent and success? If the answer to this question has proved elusive to you, then this book, Talent Is Overrated, is for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Geoff Colvin is not just any other journalist, he writes for Fortune magazine as an editor and so is conversant with what makes a good business read. It&rsquo;s not so difficult to know when a book has been written by a journalist.&nbsp; On the average the research in support of the thesis in such books is often overdone. Talent is Overrated is one of such books. It was written by a journalist who appears to have felt a great need to show clearly how the book&rsquo;s summations were arrived at. In the knowledge that business leaders consistently seek to boost personal, staff and corporate performance, Mr. Colvin&rsquo;s books identify, through extensive research what according to him, &ldquo;really separates the world-class performers from everybody else&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It opens with an account of Jeffrey Immelt and Steve Ballmer erstwhile Chief Executives of General Electric and Microsoft respectively, tucked away in the Cincinnati offices of global consumer goods giant Procter and Gamble. The basic question here, according to the book is what it was about that set them apart from others and led to their immense career successes from such a seemingly innocuous position? Was it the talent that they possessed or was it something else? What is it about them that sets them aside and enables them to achieve the success others can only dream of?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Very early in the book the emphasis on research is established. Among its research outcomes is the concept and role of what Mr. Colvin refers to as &ldquo;deliberate practice&rdquo; where the quest to excel is defined by a definite plan to improve areas of identified weakness in any endeavour through practice. There is the suggestion that while everyone may have the desire to improve through practice, only few engage in the discipline because it requires you to organise your life routines in specific ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It goes on to posit the theory that even within deliberate practice there exists a &ldquo;ten-year rule&rdquo; of continuous application in an endeavour without which no practitioner can reach the top ranks. Frustratingly, Mr. Colvin summarises that while deliberate practice may be part of the answer, it is not all of the answer to excellent performance. The book goes on to introduce other elements of excellent performance such as &ldquo;Deep Domain Expertise&rdquo; which refers to some form of specialisation in the area of choosing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You do require quite a bit of patience to read through the book&rsquo;s various researches, their outcomes and practical illustrations of those researches. But if you can muster that patience then the body of knowledge exhibited in the writings is truly revealing. Whether or not you eventually choose to put in to practice your new-found knowledge is quite another thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">One thing is certain though, Talent Is Overrated will intellectually task you, test your patience and get you thinking about your own performance all in equal measure. It is not a &ldquo;how to&rdquo; book and in that sense may disappoint its readers. What it does offer is a path, among many, towards better understanding how and to what extent, if at all, talent influences high performance.</p>",

            "title": "\u201cZero To One\u201d By Peter Thiel",
            "slug": "zero-to-one-by-peter-thiel",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Okay it&rsquo;s a best seller! Any book or at least the first book from Peter Thiel was guaranteed, well almost guaranteed, to be a best seller. Written by a celebrated outside the box tech evangelist, Zero to One was always going to be possessed of a Tech Spirit, the kind that only Mr. Thiel, its author, can conjure. And he really does conjure up something special here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perhaps driven by tech related efficiency it espouses, the book is an intriguingly smart one day read with plenty of the contrarian views on business, education and life generally that Mr. Thiel has often expressed publicly. More than a few readers, though, would have preferred the book to be a biography for the simple reason that they would want to know more about the thesis that is Peter Thiel. Fortunately, the views expressed in the book leaves no reader in doubt about what a Peter Thiel biography would resemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From the beginning Zero to One holds dear the uniqueness, value and power of not just ideas but new ideas in the world of business. The book&rsquo;s title is derived from that magic moment when something new is created, essentially taking the world from a zero (non-existent) position to one of existence. This existence is represented by the numeral one. The use of binary symbolism (zero and one) is not lost to anyone familiar with the programing and coding background of the writer. And he actually does a good job of using technology to tell a fast-paced business story about innovation and its impact on the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">According to Mr. Thiel, &ldquo;Zero to One is about how to build companies that create new things&rdquo; and to that you might want to add &ldquo;new things that are technology based&rdquo; because he leans heavily on his experience of being part of successful startup technology companies like Paypal, Palantir, Facebook and SpaceX. Not a bad resume to build your authority on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mr. Thiel says that, many of the book&rsquo;s ideas came from him teaching a course about startups at Stanford University in 2012 and was put together with help from one of his then students. In Zero to One Mr. Thiel defines a startup as &ldquo;the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.&rdquo; He goes on to suggest that, &ldquo;new thinking is a new company&rsquo;s most important strength as it questions received ideas and rethinks business from scratch.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you like economic debates you will find chapters three and four quite absorbing as they present the debate between monopoly and competition in a new light and cast Mr. Thiel in his true capitalist nature. He argues that the more monopolist a company is the happier it is while competition does little to improve the joys of a company. The best way, then, to enjoy the riches of a monopolist, at least until regulation comes along, is to create something new that differentiates you from what already exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The purely business minded will almost certainly find the first half of the book captivating and racing, as it propounds thesis after thesis on the role of innovation or better still creation, in business leadership and how best to capture the value so created.&nbsp; In the second half the book somewhat loses its business verve and zip as it pursues other ideals which, though business related, may be regarded as being more historical than front burner for a startup in search of validation and survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is probably safe to think that the compact number of pages that make up the size of Zero to One is a strength because it brings strong focus to the issues under discussion. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s the outside the box business thinking that Peter Thiel has become known for, his leaning that technology is the only way forward in value enhancing creativity and his thoughts on how best to commercially capture that value, that makes the book compelling to have as a business book on your book shelf.</p>",

While some of these events were new, others have become an annual feature of the small business economic landscape, contributing millions of Naira to Nigeria&rsquo;s small business economy. In this article VWS examines which major small business focused events shaped 2018 and what their outlook for 2019 is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The 2018 International Drinks Festival (IDF)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://vwsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rework-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Even as a concept event, the first edition of IDF in 2017 was a success, attracting several visitors and exhibitors many of whom are key local and international players in the drinks industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Emboldened by the outcome in 2017, 2018 saw the event&rsquo;s scope enlarged and duration extended by a few more days to accommodate the addition of specialised master classes and industry players&rsquo; only seminars to go along with the regular exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Visitors, who turned up in their numbers, were treated to an amazing time that offered them the opportunity to familiarize their minds and taste buds with locally and internationally made drinks. Commercial trade and consumer interactions with drink brands, retailers and local distributors was clearly evident throughout the event&rsquo;s duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With a fast-growing reputation in the event management industry, Balmoral, the organisers of the IDF, will surely want to keep this streak going. It is for this reason that event sponsors, exhibitors and visitors will eagerly look forward to IDF in 2019.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Lagos Comic Convention (LCC) </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://vwsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC00171-for-Comic-Con-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The LCC was certainly the biggest geek and pop culture event in Nigeria in&nbsp;2018, providing the creative industry a platform to showcase and market their wealth of talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Organised by Mustard Seed Communications consistently for the last seven years, this event has gained good traction with stakeholders including sponsors, visitors and exhibitors. Its popularity has carried over from other Comicon events held regularly all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The theme for 2018, &ldquo;Aspire, Dream, Prosper&rdquo;, was exemplified by the nearly 3,000 visitors and exhibitors, many of them small business owners, who thronged to the venue for the one day event. The LCC can easily pass for a concert, trade fair, art gallery, gaming haven and intellectual zone put together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To become a truly great event, LCC will need to become a two-day event and also forge a closer integration with Nollywood, as Nigeria&rsquo;s film industry is called. With its unique value proposition, it is unlikely that sponsor will need much persuasion to sign up for a second day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The crowd buzz here is like no other, the organisation is great and the venue more than appropriate. This leaves LCC 2019 looking like a must attend event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>TechFest </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://vwsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC03815-for-techfest-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A new introduction to the small business event calendar, Techfest was organized by Diamond Bank, alongside partners such as Visa, MTN, NIBBS, Microsoft, Interswitch, Delloitte, and The Beat 99.9 FM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Apparently, sponsorship was not an issue for this event in its first edition in 2018 but rather how to successfully drive the current global technology innovation trend through local engagements. Applications to attend the event crested at about 5,000 ensuring that the venue was heavily packed over the 3 days of the event, providing technology players an opportunity to amplify their work to both old and newer audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With the impending merger between Diamond Bank (the event&rsquo;s headline sponsor) and Access Bank, the fate of Techfest appears to hang in the balance. Will the new merged entity keep faith with the event? Quite likely, even if only to tap into the emerging market opportunities technology is creating especially in the small business space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>GT Bank Food &amp; Drinks Fair</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://vwsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/zzzz-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Having distinguished itself over its 3 years of existence, this event has undoubtedly&nbsp;become one of Nigeria&rsquo;s most anticipated annual&nbsp;food events. Sponsorship is guaranteed by the event owner, tier one Nigerian lender, Guaranty Trust Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The three-day event draws thousands of visitors which serves as a rendezvous for small business owners in the food and drinks business. The event organisers have continuously scaled up its impact on the food and drinks industry and the GT brand as well, including the growth of its small business franchise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Innovation has never been lacking in each of the last 3 editions and early indications are that not only will the event hold in 2019, but that it will do so in bigger fashion than what was seen in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>GT Bank Fashion Weekend</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://vwsng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image1-for-GT-FSHN-WKND-300x225.jpeg\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another flagship event from Guaranty Trust Bank, the GT Fashion Weekend has been successful enough to spurn a product, fashion credit, that provides lending from the Bank to small business in the fashion industry. This alone is proof enough that the event is here to stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the 2018 edition, much was made of the event&rsquo;s local roots and global Pan African ambitions. This theme would likely continue and be taken even deeper in 2019. Sponsorship is guaranteed, attendance keeps breaking new records each subsequent year, with over 50,000 visitors in 2018. For the GT Fashion Weekend, it&rsquo;s not a question of if, but rather, what date in the calendar should be blocked in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There surely were other events that caught the eye in 2018, but for their sheer contribution to small businesses, they probably don&rsquo;t come bigger than these five. And in the interest of several small business owners, it is important that they all hold in 2019.</p>",

            "title": "Ryteprint Overhauls Operation: Now Delivers Nationwide At N1,000!",
            "slug": "ryteprint-overhauls-operation-now-delivers-nationwide-at-n1000",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On Wednesday, 9th January 2019, in Lagos, Nigeria, Ryteprint signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Nigeria&rsquo;s foremost parcel delivery service for the nationwide delivery of her products. This partnership now enables Ryteprint to distribute products anywhere in the country at just N1,000 only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ryteprint.com is a leading printed products platform in Nigeria. It enables individuals, micro, small &amp; medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) and bigger organizations to buy high quality, custom-made, printed products. The firm reputed to be the biggest print shop in West Africa and a leading online print service company in the industry offers doorstep delivery as a key service component of its product proposition. The firm recently overhauled her operations for improved productive capacity in terms of product quality and timeliness of output with state-of-the-art machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Furthermore, the firm which is a market leader in the production of items such as Business Cards, Letter Heads, Flyers, Lanyards, Invitation Cards, Envelopes of all sizes, Notebooks, Paper Bags, Mug, Canvas Print, Clothing, A0 &ndash; A7 jumbo print among others adopted this new delivery system to enhance its effectiveness and grab more market share. However, what is interesting about this operational overhaul and collaboration with one of Nigeria&rsquo;s premier parcel delivery firms is the affordability and convenience it offers customers. N1, 000 delivery fee irrespective of a customer&rsquo;s location in Nigeria is a stunning marketing strategy and only time will tell of the extent of its success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Consequent to the operations overhaul and the delivery service collaboration by Ryteprint, several reactions from stakeholders have trailed this new development. In fact, one of Ryteprint&rsquo;s customers, who lives in Port-Harcourt and used this new delivery service commented that</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Your new delivery at N1,000 is the best [thing] that could happen [to me, right now] and I am already in to order more [of your products] for my organisation&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ryteprint&rsquo;s Managing Director, Olawale Awani explained the reason for the impressive reviews by customers and industry stakeholders as</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t relent in making the experience better, we encourage our customers to keep ordering on our platform www.ryteprint.com and [to] take advantage of our new delivery system&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finally, Ryteprint.com is repositioning itself to become a key player in the Nigeria print industry. This is a herculean task with industry heavyweights like Printivo in the background and the fact that price elasticity of demand for printing is relatively inelastic. On the other hand, the Nigerian print industry is seasonal and operators report that higher revenues recorded are skewed towards electioneering periods. It therefore remains to be seen how this impressive pricing strategy will contribute to the fortunes of Ryteprint.com in the year 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In sum, Ryteprint has refit its operations with state-of-the art machinery and collaborated with a premier parcel delivery service to offer an amazing N1, 000 flat rate for their product to be delivered anywhere in Nigeria. Stakeholders&rsquo; reaction so far has been positive while critics believe this new delivery price strategy will only create a marginal improvement in profitability of the firm due to the nature of the print industry.</p>",

            "title": "Inward Sourcing Keeps DNS Fabrics in Business",
            "slug": "inward-sourcing-keeps-dns-fabrics-in-business",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For nearly two decades DNS Fabrics had been a long-time importer of fabrics from India and Holland principally. But towards the end of 2016, the cost of importation rose sharply as the Naira rapidly depreciated in value against the Dollar as USD1 exchanged for N360.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Faced with this challenge, rather than go out of business the company devised a survival strategy that involved the patronage of local fabrics manufacturers. For Bolaji Akintola, Managing Director of DNS, this was a business saving move that has proved itself. According to him &ldquo;To remain in business and make profit, we knew we had to change our sourcing strategy. Patronage of local fabrics companies was the key. So we decided to patronize local fabrics manufacturers like Femro 3 and Sunflag Nigeria Limited&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a startup fifteen years ago, DNS Fabrics set up shop with the aim of making available all kinds of fabrics Georges, Hollandaise and Laces at an affordable price for its clientele. But by 2016 the situation in the foreign exchange market had begun to make importation challenging and push the price of the products beyond the reach of their customers. At this point, the company decided the time was right for a strategic rethink which led to the decision to source the fabrics its sold locally within Nigeria. &ldquo;Though there has been a drastic reduction in our international sourcing activities, we haven&rsquo;t completely stopped. But there is definitely a shift in balance in favour of locally sourced fabric&rdquo; Bolaji disclosed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With annual revenue estimated in the region of N15m for 2017, DNS supports its operations with both ad hoc staff and a permanent staff of five persons. On 2018, Bolaji says that the plan is grow the brand and one of the identified trends that the company will target is the increasing demand by the market for Ghanaian made fabrics.<br />\r\nWith the business flexibility that DNS has already demonstrated through its willingness to adapt to a changing market place and economic pressure, the company is increasingly confident that it can successfully execute its 2018 strategic plans.</p>",

            "title": "The Search for Winning TV Content: How Nigerian Small Business Media Entrepreneurs can Benefit.",
            "slug": "the-search-for-winning-tv-content-how-nigerian-small-business-media-entrepreneurs-can-benefit",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The media world is at an interesting juncture right now where broadcast, entertainment and technology have intersected with globalization and the internationalization of business. If this all sounds confusing to you, then welcome to the world of content and new media. The internet and live-streaming of content is changing all that we ever knew about broadcast patterns. Linear television is fast exceeding its shelf live and Pay TV (at least in the developed world) is shedding subscribers. In videos, Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) is the new kid on the block with Netflix and Amazon Prime leading the charge, while YouTube, Vimeo and Hulu are all reshaping what we understand TV to mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">All this is made possible by the increasing democratization of internet by mobile data together with that inseparable companion of the modern-day individual, the Smart Phone. The Smart Phone and other digital devices together have brought the concept of the second screen (another screen in addition to the TV screen) into its holder&rsquo;s lives and living rooms. If you are a media entrepreneur, raise a glass and toast because these are exciting times for you, filled with growth opportunities. Entry barriers into the broadcast industry have all but disappeared as distribution is available everywhere (you don&rsquo;t need to set up a TV station to have a channel) and access to global markets is guaranteed through the internet. &nbsp;The only challenge is who will supply the winning content to fill the millions of hours of programming required by all these platforms and the channels they host. Too much TV everywhere but not enough winning content in the supply pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a probable or already existing media entrepreneur there are several points along the media value chain through which you can gain entrance into the growth and disruption that the global media industry is presently experiencing. In terms of the ability to monetize value, content provision appears to be the fastest route more so with the large number of channel providers on offer. Excluding investments planned by Amazon and other mainstream media companies like Disney and HBO, Apple and Netflix plan to spend a combined $10bn in original content production in 2018. The search for winning content has really assumed global proportions. Even on the domestic scene, while their production budgets may not be publicly available channels provided by Multichoice, Red TV, Ndani TV, Accelerate TV and every one in between are in the market for award winning TV content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So where better to start as a media entrepreneur than in content production.&nbsp; A report from global professional services firm PWC reinforces the opportunities that lie in the TV space which is expected to top $1bn by the end of 2021. This growth will be driven by mobile internet penetration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:0px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>MARKET SIZE</strong></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>SEGMENT</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2018e</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2019e</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2020e</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2021e</strong></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">$&rsquo;000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">$&rsquo;000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">$&rsquo;000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">$&rsquo;000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Internet</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;3,800,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;4,180,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;4,750,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;5,220,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>TV</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;851,835</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;877,390</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;905,466</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;935,347</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:347px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align:justify\">Table 1: Growth in Market Size of Internet and TV Industry in Nigeria</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With numbers like this it is near impossible that these channels can internally produce all of the TV content they require to meet their scheduled number of programming hours and will therefore rely on independent content producers to bridge the gap. To profitably access this content market small business media entrepreneurs, need to understand a six elements matrix and how these elements combine to deliver sustainable success in the media content industry. These elements include finance, people, legal, infrastructure, content and distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Finance:</strong>&nbsp;In raising finance for their media content projects, it is helpful for small business media entrepreneurs to know the impact of debt on their operations. This is because the content production and monetistaion process takes a while to conclude its flow from creation to the receipt of payment. As the monetisation process shifts gears from idea, to commissioning, production, sales and eventually payment, debt as a first choice among financing alternatives for any content production plan remains a tricky choice. Where possible a mix of savings and crowd funding should be utilized first before debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Legal:</strong>&nbsp;Content in whatever form (idea, product or as a library collection) is intellectual property and its owner should endeavor to acquire legal protection for it. Not minding the perceived costs, legal protection of intellectual property is always worth it because of the future streams of income it can generate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Infrastructure:</strong>&nbsp;Media infrastructure such as studios, camera&rsquo;s and graphics software are expensive. After receiving a project commissioning, a small business media entrepreneur&rsquo;s first consideration for infrastructure should be studio rental and the lease of equipment to be used for the shoot. To cut down on studio rental costs, rehearsals and planning should as much as possible take place and be perfected outside the studio so that as much purchased studio time as possible is devoted to the actual shoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Distribution:</strong>&nbsp;Fortunately for small business media entrepreneurs, technology and the internet have combined to make and keep making distribution of content a lot easier than it previously was. Whether on YouTube, Vimeo or other video hosting sites, it is now possible to secure global and domestic viewing of your content and attract commissions or revenue (through advertising and subscriptions) form the comfort of your computer. A channel can be owned without building TV station and this saves time and cost to market as well as improves access to market at lower cost while reducing lead time to revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>People:</strong>&nbsp;Of the six elements identified above, people is perhaps the toughest element to get hold of. While it is possible for content to be created by one person, it is not sustainable from a commercial perspective. Content development is a creative art, and for reasons of cost and the difficulty in finding the right people to execute the creator&rsquo;s vision many early stage small business media entrepreneurs often opt to go it alone. If their works find acceptance, markets and revenue, they are sooner than later overwhelmed by the requirement of sustaining both quality and quantity. &nbsp;There really is no silver bullet solution to the people issue for early stage content producers but continuous communication with the assembled team about the creative direction and strategy of the content to be produced helps to mitigate this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Despite the challenge of understanding the interplay of these six elements, there is a general agreement among industry observers that the scope of opportunities available to small business media entrepreneurs is very significant. These opportunities are supported by the lower entry barriers brought about by technology and the exponential growth in the demand for winning content globally.</p>",

            "slug": "how-jahemilink-enterprise-brings-fashion-status-class-to-dunlop-foot-wears",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pride is sometimes interpreted as a negative word but hardly so in the case of an entrepreneur holding and looking down at a his or her finished product. This is the image and expression cut by Emelia Hassan, a 27-year-old Entrepreneur and founder of Jahemilink Enterprise in her conversation with VWS at the 2017 GT Fashion weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Starting out in 2016, with a seed fund of just \u20a625, 000 Emelia set up Jahemilink a company that focuses on the production of beaded fashion foot wears made out of Dunlop. Today the blooming enterprise is estimated to make revenues of \u20a62.6m in 2017 and despite this is still not able to meet the demand for her products. This inability to meet demand is demonstrated in the company not being able to fill their stand with display products and even had to display products that already been pre-sold to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As part of her startup strategies, before launching Jahemilink Enterprise in 2016, Emelia conducted a market acceptance survey to gauge the potential demand for the niche product she hoped to launch into the market. She made two samples of the products and handed them out as gifts to friends within her network. And to her delight, within a week she had received an order to make five pairs of her foot ware design. Each pair is presently priced at \u20a62,000 and based on an estimated cost price of \u20a61,200 the product has a healthy gross margin of 66%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For Emelia finding the capital that will help her grow Jahemilink to its full market potential remains a major challenge and priority. Yes, she may have come to the fair to exhibit her products, create awareness and build her sales order, another reason for exhibiting that is lurking in the back of her mind is the hope of attracting investors. For her, relying entirely on organic growth from internally generated funding will not accelerate the business. She continues to explore the possibilities of accessing one of the intervention funds from any of the government agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another area that challenges the business is the rising cost of the beads that constitute the major raw materials used by Jahemilink&rsquo;s in making its products.&nbsp; Emelia explains to VWS that she has been fortunate in this regard as a result of the margins she can make on her products, she said &ldquo;because the demand for my products is actually on the rise, it&rsquo;s easier for me to maintain a positive profit margin, though it might not be huge but yes it&rsquo;s a profitable business all the same&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Looking into the future Emelia is optimistic that she will attract the capital she seeks to enable her grow Jahemilink to its full potential and well beyond. Given the uniqueness of her product, there is no reason not to agree with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>",

            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before now, buying stuff simply meant going to the shops to search for it, make payment and pick it up. Not anymore. Those shops and markets now compete and in many cases are being replaced by huge digital platforms. Behind these digital platforms are some of the world&rsquo;s largest technology companies like Apple, Google, eBay, Facebook, Netflix, Sportify, PayPal, Twitter, Amazon, Uber, Airbnb and the list goes on. In almost every sector, these companies have reshaped our understanding of what shops and markets are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From music, movies, payment systems, consumer retailing, transportation, hotels, to newspapers few industries have been spared the advancing makeover of these digital platforms. But how exactly are these digital platforms creating modern day markets?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The basic principle of a shop or market is a place where goods and services can be sold and bought. In times past both buyer and seller needed to be brought together under one roof. But not anymore because digital platforms have changed the dynamic of how, when and where buyers and sellers can meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Market For Music</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Apple&rsquo;s creation of the iTunes store and making it exclusively accessible through its devices, first the iPod, Macs and then the iPhone and iPad fundamentally changed the entire commerce of the music business away from the sale and purchase of CDs in shops. With over a billion devices in the hands of consumers, the iTunes virtual store has become a digital platform where music can be bought and sold, increasingly replacing physical stores as the market place for music. These digital platforms have also helped music progress from an ownership to a rental model and in the process reinforced themselves clearly as the new market place. The dominance of digital music platforms over physical stores is better appreciated when the patronage of iTunes is combined with that of other well-regarded digital music platform like Sportify, Google and Amazon resulting in nearly a billion individual paying subscribers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Market For Movies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The impact of digital movie platforms on physical stores is similar to what is happening in the music business if not greater. Of the several existing digital movie platforms Netflix is perhaps the best known globally. But Amazon, through Amazon Prime, Apple through its iTunes store and Google through its Google Play Store also have significant footprints in digital movie platforms. And this has proved sufficient to make these platforms the new market place for movies away from physical stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Market For Transport Services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Uber&rsquo;s ride sharing digital transportation platform may not have obliterated physical taxies completely, at least not yet, but has certainly transformed it. As the largest global provider of transport services, the scale of Uber is so large that it continues to attract regulatory concerns in several markets. With its digital transport platforms, Uber and its competitors like Grab, Lyft and Taxify now command a huge chunk of daily global transport services the likes of which traditional taxi markets are unlikely to recover from anytime soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Market For Hotel Rooms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Airbnb&rsquo;s digital platform for hotel services is by far the largest global network of hotels available. It offers users a variety of hotel services even in far flung and remote locations that physical hotel chains can only dream of. Its wide spread global success has also attracted regulatory concerns in various jurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Market For Newspapers and Magazine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Facebook, Google, Twitter, Flipboard and several other digital platforms have forever altered the market for newspapers. In terms of readership, distribution, breaking news and subscription or advertising revenue there is no comparison between these platforms and physical newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Market For Books</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Just like Google and Wikipedia irreparably damaged the market for physical encyclopedias, Amazon&rsquo;s online retail platform for books has led to the closure of several physical bookshops. The arrival of e-books has added to the poor business conditions being experienced by bookshops and the combined digital platforms of Amazon, Google Books and Apple&rsquo;s iBooks have mainly been responsible for this negative trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Despite the dominance of these digital platforms over physical markets, many technology and retail analysts believe that this is only the beginning. Technology companies build platforms around users of their products and services. The speed and scale with which this happens leaves physical stores with little or no time to respond until the transformation is firmly rooted in consumer behaviour. It sometimes looks so inevitable leaving physical stores with little choice than to digitize their own services as well. Bogged down by legacy assets like buildings and stock, they have often failed to respond successfully and as a result the platforms continue to get larger.</p>",

            "title": "Seven Ways Technology Is Changing The Media Industry",
            "slug": "seven-ways-technology-is-changing-the-media-industry",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Across all the traditional media platforms, technology has continued to disrupt the media industry in ways previously unknown. In print, radio and television, the advice to industry players is the same, adapt to the new digital world or risk death. It&rsquo;s not a question of if, but when technology will affect the fortunes of each traditional player. The pace of this disruption may vary by jurisdiction but the impact is the same. Here are four ways in which technology is changing the media industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Lower Entry and Exit Barriers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The internet is one key piece of technology that has probably done the most to lower the entry and exit barriers into the media industry. The existence of affordable internet has enabled text, audio and video websites, computers, servers, cloud computing services, video compression technology and rentable software (software as a service) to tremendously lower the infrastructure costs required to launch a media platform, making it easier for more people than ever to enter or exit the industry. There is no longer a requirement for huge capital layouts to purchase spectrum, equipment, printing paper or other infrastructure. There are now more cost-effective technology enabled alternatives</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Larger Media Markets and Greater Audience Segmentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">No longer is content distribution or the number of possible media players in the industry impeded by the limited reach of spectrum, frequencies or bands. &nbsp;The internet is a limitless platform host and content distribution channel, that has enabled greater use of smart mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets to increase the size, diversity and inclusiveness of media markets. Media behavioral patterns have also been altered by technology in favor of non-linear (unscheduled programming) versus programmed media consumption. The content anywhere, everywhere, whenever made possible by mobile technologies has liberated media consumers from the shackles of time, space and place. The personalised nature of mobile devices has also segmented media markets and created multiple audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Increased Number of Content Creators, Content Specialisation and Content Variety</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Technology has made possible the availability of multiple media platform such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and others. This has led to an increase in the number of content creators beyond the professional cadre to include amateur who are taking advantage of lower entry barriers into content creation to reshape the media industry. With a wider and deeper media market available to them, content creators now provide more specialised content in a wider variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creation of a New Type of Media Marketing Professionals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The role of the media marketing professional has been disrupted beyond their knowledge and understanding of traditional media platforms like newspapers, radio and television. One reason for this is the difference in the online media habits of consumers when compared with their known traditional patterns. Faced with the challenge of understanding the online behaviour of a higher number and larger variety of media consumers across more platforms, media marketing professionals have to constantly retool themselves with new skills. The advantage they have is that unlike the traditional platforms, technology driven platforms offer various accurate scientifically accurate tools that can be used to measure the habits of people who consume media via their platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Media Convergence and Consolidation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The line between technology companies, media companies and telecom companies is now blurred. For instance, it is difficult to determine whether global companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google are technology or media companies. Or whether telecom giants like Verizon, MTN and AT&amp;T are telecom or media companies. The inability to answer this question clearly has naturally led to a consolidation of media, telecom and technology companies. AT&amp;T, a core telecoms company has recently purchased Time Warner, a pure play traditional media company. Before then Verizon another pure play telecom company had purchased Yahoo a technology company with online media assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Demand for Content Has Made Premium Content More Valuable and Expensive</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The existence of several media platforms and the ease with which new players can launch media platforms has increased the global demand for content to fill all of these platforms. Media consumers always seek out the best content and creators of such content are charging ever higher prices for them, year-on-year especially access to live sports events such as the English Premier League (EPL) and National Basketball Association (NBA). Generally, the more globally successful the content is the higher the premium to be paid for rights to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) is Now Media&rsquo;s Fastest Growing Segment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It&rsquo;s no secret that Netflix, with its subscription video on demand model, is the major threat to the traditional television and Pay TV industry to the extent that Disney has locked Netflix out of its content and is launching its own streaming service in 2019. The threat of the SVOD model comes from the fact that it allows subscribers choose from a large catalog of movies and watch those movies when they want, where they want and how they want to at a fraction of what Pay TV operators charge for there often unwatched hundreds of channels. Moreover, both Pay TV and traditional television are linear (they offer scheduled programs) and offer only limited flexibility in the viewing experience.</p>",

            "title": "Apple\u2019s Patient March To Success With Apple Maps",
            "slug": "apples-patient-march-to-success-with-apple-maps",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Six years have passed since September 2012, when Apple released Apple Map and earlier criticism of the app have been all but forgotten. Fast forward to 2018 and the iPhone maker has announced that it is rebuilding the Apple Map App from ground up with its own data sets along with data from its longtime mapping data services provider Tom Tom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At its peak, problems associated with the Apple Map app service got so bad that it eventually led to the firing of Scot Forestall, its then maps chief and longtime executive. &nbsp;Its Chief Executive, Tim Cook was also forced to eat humble pie and make a public apology. Since those early days Apple has continued to improve its map app to the extent that it is now the most frequently used app on its iPhones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before the launch of the Apple Map app, Google Map was the default map application on Apples iPhone. But trouble started in late 2009 when the Android version of Google Map featured a turn-by-turn navigation feature that the iOS version lacked. Accusations from Apple that Google collected too much user data from their iPhones then followed. Turn-by-turn navigation may have started the map wars but both companies have since moved on from those days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Apple Map initially relied on data from Tom Tom, but the new Apple Map will be completely rebuilt with data gathered from its own fleet of sensor-equipped vans and anonymous data from iPhone users that choose to share it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Behind the eventual success of Apple Map is a dual product strategy, characterized by patience and an inhouse expertise development program which has become all too familiar with Apple. And the process works like this, first Apple outsources the supply of a greater part of the inputs required for its product or service to third party suppliers. Once an input is identified as critical to the long-term success of an Apple product or service, Apple overtime develops the inhouse capacity to internally produce the input, making it even more proprietary. Aided by its huge resources of talent, patents, cash, the iPhone and its nearly one billion users, Apple then adds staying power to the trial, perfection and integration of in-house developed inputs to the product and service resulting in much better product or service than earlier released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Whether it&rsquo;s in chips, batteries, Apple music, Siri, ear pods, home pods or Apple Watch this dual strategy is very evident. What is however not always so evident by an often cynically demanding general public in the tide of the high-performance expectations from anything Apple, is Apple&rsquo;s intent and determination, to patiently stay the course until a new product or service becomes a winner. Even if unknowing to them, the intense loyalty of Apple product and service users is traceable to this dual strategy of patience and inhouse expertise development. It has become one of the foundations on which Apple customers build their trust in the reliability of Apple products and services. They are confident investing in Apple products or services safe in the knowledge that Apple will not readily abandon any of its underwhelming products or services halfway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>An argument exists about Apple Map that the immense popularity of map services among mobile phone users made it impossible for Apple to contemplate discontinuing its map app. While this is a valid point, it is the stealthy manner in which Apple has stayed in the maps game since those early difficult days and years, when Apple Map was all but written off, that makes its success remarkable. With the winds behind its sail together with important data that was unavailable at first launch, Apple is now rebuilding Apple Map from bottom up. For those who might argue that this is not a strategy, a glance at the history of the iPad and more recently the Apple Watch, Air Pod and Home Pod will show that patience and an inhouse expertise development program is a proven, even if unknown, Apple strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this era of Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous and Self-Driving cars, Apple&rsquo;s patience and determination with Apple Map will prove worth it especially as cars are becoming a key market for Voice-Controlled Maps. The &euro;2.8bn purchase of Here, Nokia&rsquo;s Digital Mapping Service in 2015 by the consortium of Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler is an indication of the what the future role of maps will be in cars and the steps the auto industry is taking to prevent a Google-Apple duopoly of mapping services in cars by owning its own technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Apple&rsquo;s quiet behind the scene development of Apple Map has kept the service competitive all this while and now its public redevelopment of the service is about to take Apple Map out of sight.</p>",

            "slug": "how-can-nigerias-sme-media-entrepreneurs-satisfy-consumer-demand",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The media world is at an interesting juncture right now where broadcast, entertainment and technology have intersected with globalisation and the internationalisation of business. If this all sounds confusing to you, then welcome to the world of content and new media. The internet and live streaming of content is changing all that we ever knew about broadcast patterns. Linear television is fast exceeding its shelf live and Pay TV (at least in the developed world) is shedding subscribers. In videos, Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) is the new kid on the block with Netflix and Amazon Prime leading the charge, while YouTube, Vimeo and Hulu are all reshaping what we understand TV to mean. All this is made possible by the increasing democratisation of internet by mobile data together with that inseparable companion of the modern-day individual, the Smart Phone. The Smart Phone and other digital devices together have brought the concept of the second screen (another screen in addition to the TV screen) into its holder&rsquo;s lives and living rooms. If you are a media entrepreneur, raise a glass and toast because these are exciting times for you, filled with growth opportunities.&nbsp;}&nbsp;Entry barriers into the broadcast industry have all but disappeared as distribution is available everywhere (you don&rsquo;t need to set up a TV station to have a channel) and access to global markets is guaranteed through the internet. The only challenge is who will supply the winning content to fill the millions of hours of programming required by all these platforms and the channels they host. Too much TV everywhere but not enough winning content in the supply pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a probable or already existing media entrepreneur, there are several points along the media value chain through which you can gain entrance into the growth and disruption that the global media industry is presently experiencing. In terms of the ability to monetise value, content provision appears to be the fastest route more so with the large number of channel providers on offer. Excluding investments planned by Amazon and other mainstream media companies like Disney and HBO, Apple and Netflix plan to spend a combined $10bn in original content production in 2018. The search for winning content has really assumed global proportions. Even on the domestic scene, while their production budgets may not be publicly available channels provided by Multichoice, Red TV, Ndani TV, Accelerate TV and everyone in between are in the market for award-winning TV content. So where better to start as a media entrepreneur than in content production. A report from global professional services firm PWC reinforces the opportunities that lie in the TV space which is expected to top $1bn by the end of 2021.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Growth in Market Size of Internet and TV Industry in Nigeria</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With numbers like this, it is near impossible that these channels can internally produce all of the TV content they require to meet their scheduled number of programming hours and will, therefore, rely on independent content producers to bridge the gap. To profitably access this content market small business media entrepreneurs, need to understand a six elements matrix and how these elements combine to deliver sustainable success in the media content industry. These elements include finance, people, legal, infrastructure, content, and distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finance: In raising finance for their media content projects, it is helpful for small business media entrepreneurs to know the impact of debt on their operations. This is because the content production and monetisation process takes a while to conclude its flow from creation to the receipt of payment. As the monetisation process shifts gears from idea, to commissioning, production, sales and eventually payment, debt as a first choice among financing alternatives for any content production plan remains a tricky choice. Where possible a mix of savings and crowdfunding should be utilised first before debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Legal: Content in whatever form (idea, product or as a library collection) is intellectual property and its owner should endeavor to acquire legal protection for it. Not minding the perceived costs, legal protection of intellectual property is always worth it because of the future streams of income it can generate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Infrastructure: Media infrastructure such as studios, camera&rsquo;s and graphics software are expensive. After receiving a project commissioning, a small business media entrepreneur&rsquo;s first consideration for infrastructure should be studio rental and the lease of equipment to be used for the shoot. To cut down on studio rental costs, rehearsals and planning should as much as possible take place and be perfected outside the studio so that as much purchased studio time as possible is devoted to the actual shoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Distribution: Fortunately for small business media entrepreneurs, technology and the internet have combined to make and keep making distribution of content a lot easier than it previously was. Whether on YouTube, Vimeo or other video hosting sites, it is now possible to secure global and domestic viewing of your content and attract commissionings or revenue (through advertising and subscriptions) form the comfort of your computer. A channel can be owned without building TV station and this saves time and cost to market as well as improves access to market at lower cost while reducing lead time to revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">People: Of the six elements identified above, people is perhaps the toughest element to get hold of. While it is possible for content to be created by one person, it is not sustainable from a commercial perspective. Content development is a creative art, and for reasons of cost and the difficulty in finding the right people to execute the creator&rsquo;s vision many early stage small business media entrepreneurs often opt to go it alone. If their works find acceptance, markets and revenue, they are sooner than later overwhelmed by the requirement of sustaining both quality and quantity. There really is no silver bullet solution to the people issue for early stage content producers but continuous communication with the assembled team about the creative direction and strategy of the content to be produced helps to mitigate this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Despite the challenge of understanding the interplay of these six elements, there is a general agreement among industry observers that the scope of opportunities available to small business media entrepreneurs is very significant. These opportunities are supported by the lower entry barriers brought about by technology and the exponential growth in the demand for winning content globally.</p>",

            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Coopetition; which is the application of the understanding of game theory to collaborate with competitors in a hope for mutually beneficial outcomes. This has seen smart companies around the globe use the understanding of game theory to collaborate with competitors in a hope of mutually beneficial outcomes. For instance, in 2011, Mozilla Firefox continued its funding deal with Google, maker of the rival web browser &ndash; Google Chrome; in what industry experts say is a strategy for Google to stave off dominance of other rival web-browsers like Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This deal implied that Mozilla reportedly net about $300million a year during the tenure. A more vivid example is the deal between Amazon and Apple which allowed Amazon e-books to be available to iPad users through the iPad Kindle app. This enables both companies to generate and retain value while simultaneously competing with each other on other fronts. The innovative strategy, aptly summarized as &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t beat them, work with them&rdquo; is obviously the ideology behind TECHFEST 2018 which has some tech-industry heavy weights like Microsoft, MTN, Interswitch, and VISA as partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Therefore, in the digital landscape, it is no longer surprising to see competitors collaborating. The two day event held on the 16th of May 2018 and continued on the 17th at the Landmark Event Centre Victoria Island Lagos, Nigeria, had a mega turn out with over 8000 online applications according to Chioma Afe, Diamond Bank&rsquo;s Head of Corporate Communications with a significant amount of applications from Kaduna, Abuja and other parts of the Nigerian hinterland, though Lagos led the number of applications by almost 60 percent. The SME focused event promoted as a platform to encourage exploration, connection and collaboration had in attendance, a huge number of participants comprising mostly of Investors, Startups, event-partners and tech-enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In his opening speech, UzomaDozie, CEO of Diamond Bank, the lead organizer of TECHFEST explained that the rationale for the techfest is to encourage connection and collaboration among individuals and institutions in the tech space. He particularly mentioned that technology is an enabler and can help reach the unbanked across Nigeria faster than bank branches could. He also stated that tech education is vital as it is changing how people and institutions interact. Diamond Bank&rsquo;s Head of Corporate Communications, Chioma Afe, also reiterated his position and added that TECHFEST is about broadening digital and financial inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"169\" src=\"http://test.vbcasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/db2-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" />The event themed #SparkYourCuriosity which among other things is a celebration of how homegrown technologies are&nbsp;changing the tech landscape bustled&nbsp;with activity as intense conversations erupted at every corner signifying the success of the intention of the organizers which is exploration, connection and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Furthermore, Venture Capital usually referred to by Digital Natives as VC Fund, is an early stage private equity financing for high growth potential startups. A significant number of such investors were present at the event like Passion Incubator, Roar Hub Nigeria, Wennovation Hub and Ventures Platform. Also a number of Startups in attendance acknowledged that they had received Series A funding and were in the process of acquiring Series B. For instance, Yinka Akinbobola of Dropque, a Software as a service (SAAS) company, in a special interview with VWS confirmed that he received early-stage funding from Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) an incubator. He also confirmed and said, &ldquo;TECHFEST has met my expectations as I have met a number of potential clients&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On display at the event were tech innovations like drones, Internet of Things technologies and other devices. Most notable at the event were NIBSS &ldquo;Nigeria Inter&ndash;Bank Settlement System PLC&rdquo;, whose incubatee Fin-Tech technologies yet to launch their product &ldquo;Nigeria Fin [ancial] Map,&rdquo; with the ability to display ATM and M-Cash locations across the country as explained to VWS in an exclusive interview with NIBSS Head of research &amp; Development Aituaz Kola-Oladejo. Another equally interesting category is the innovation from tech startups pitching for TECHFEST&rsquo;s prize money in the Battle of Hubs. Dr. Eb iOfrey of GEROCARE, a tech company that provides regular home&nbsp;doctor visits for the elderly. Omozino Eguh of YUDIMY,&nbsp; a career guidance app for secondary school students and other tech startups featured in the Tech Startup Pitch Competition that held at the event on Tuesday and displayed impressive tech-solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">According to the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2017, the gradually improving global, gender parity halted and widened for the first time since 2006 making the tech industry still pretty much a man&rsquo;s world. In a recent survey from Reuters, it stated that &ldquo;no single global tech giant had achieved gender balance in their labour force&rdquo;. Also, Titi Odunfa Adeoye, Managing Director of Sankore Investments, a global investment boutique that deals in brokerage, advisory and other investment services who was a distinguished speaker at the Women in Tech Panel of the TECH FEST highlighted the gaping gender disparity in tech, based on her extensive global work experience and noted that women as a gender group are more represented at managerial levels than in the IT department. She called on female developers to rise up to the occasion. Other distinguished speakers on the TECHFEST Women in Tech panel were Ola Williams, Director, Solution Sales Microsoft Nigeria, Lynda Saint Nwafor, Chief Enterprise Business Office, MTN, Oluwakemi Okunsanya, Vice President, VISA West Africa and Linda Quaynor, Partner, Deloitte &amp;Touche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In an era of increasing coopetition, of course, this has variations in intensity and of which a popular example is BMW and Toyota, Collaborating to create hybrid technologies, vehicle electrification, and sports cars among other things. This empowers both companies to create and retain value while concurrently competing with each other on other fronts. The strategy summarized as &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t beat them, work with them&rdquo; is most likely the ideology behind TECHFEST 2018 which had some tech-industry giants like Microsoft and MTN as partners. The SME focused event definitely struck gold in the heart of participants comprising of mostly Investors, Startups, event-partners and tech-enthusiasts on this TECHFEST and it is hoped that the next one will be a far better experience.</p>",

            "title": "How Event Management Industry Is Unleashing Growth In SMEs And Startups",
            "slug": "how-event-management-industry-is-unleashing-growth-in-smes-and-startups",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Despite the infrastructure deficit in appropriate venues for events and the high cost of hiring any of the available few centres that have hosting capacity, SMEs in Nigeria are beginning to utilise events as platforms through which they can begin to realise the full commercial potential of their ideas. Events were mostly limited to musical concerts and sports in the past, but in the last five years, they have grown in both sophistication and specialization to include other activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From especially fashion to art, technology, furniture and drinks, event organisers have unleashed their creative imagination to the delight of entrepreneurs, startups, and SMEs. The era is fading away when trade fairs were the way to go for commercial breakthroughs for small businesses. It could even be argued that with the kind of exhibitors and visitors they attract trade fairs are not built as stepping stones for SME&rsquo;s let alone startups. It appears that trade fairs are failing to grasp and therefore cater to the growth and changing demographics of Nigeria&rsquo;s informal economy. This failing is perhaps what has opened the door for the emergence of the nascent event planning industry that is being witnessed today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This trend is not so much a revolution as it is an evolution and exploitation of a market gap. While there are no numbers available presently, there is a feeling that the event industry is growing rapidly and this growth may not be unrelated to the wide variety specialisations it can offer exhibitors and visitors. From drinks to cosmetics or even hair styling the scope is limitless for event managers to tap into. Events are also flexible enough to be scaled up or scaled down as the situation requires, which is a great advantage from a cost management perspective. From an aesthetics perspective trade fairs in a sense do not deliver for small new economy businesses the international look and feel that events do. The informality of events allows participants to express the uniqueness of their individuality and craft which is very important for the startups or one-man businesses that dominate the attendance of these events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So how do these specialised events benefit the small emerging new economy businesses? Firstly, a major attraction for participants to these events is the acknowledgment by organisers of how the informal economy is rapidly segmenting and promoting new kinds of jobs that demand specialized awareness platforms. With these events, event planners attempt to create a melting pot of interaction for people with common interests in a particular trade or craft specialisation and also introduce them to new audiences using subtle entertainment as a vehicle into the mind. There is the temptation to think of these events primarily as market outposts which they neither are nor are intended to be as is evident from the event sequence. The event sequence begins with creating the awareness and the interactive melting pot for the specialised area being evented. It is after this first step is successful that the marketplace then becomes a natural extension. The successful execution of this sequence by the event planner is what then grows the event and enables its participants to reap the benefits of their presence in the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another way through which events are enhancing startups is in the skills acquisition programs provided at the events. Nowhere is this acknowledgment better captured than in the adoption of the concept of Master Class Programs at almost every event today. Master Classes are a hallmark of international events. They are small classes where specialized skills in a field related to the event are taught by some of the best local and global practitioners in the chosen field to event participants and visitors who register to attend them. Exposure to the winning techniques taught in Master Classes and personal interaction with the renowned teachers orchestrating the Master Class enhance the performance of small businesses and startups. The practical lessons taught at Master Classes often remind its participants of the shortcomings of our educational system and more so our business schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">While the most obvious attraction and benefit of events to exhibitors is business growth through sales, the opportunity to attract funding for their businesses is equally a strong attraction to exhibit at events. Admittedly many exhibitors package or position themselves for the purpose of selling their goods rather than raising funds and are therefore not prepared when the opportunity comes knocking. Nevertheless, events remain a major platform through which business startups can initiate discussions about raising funds for their businesses and also better understand the fundamentals of financial intermediation from potential funders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A question worth asking is if, with all these listed benefits, there should be an expectation for an avalanche of events in the years ahead? Yes, there should, but not so fast. The event industry is undoubtedly poised for rapid growth based on its nascence, market opportunities and the role it is playing in the developing and accelerating small businesses and startups. And for all its growth rate and achievements, the industry is still incredibly young and years away from maturity. The industry&rsquo;s growth challenge will be how to overcome the gap between having an idea for an event and successfully organizing it. There are at least three major challenges that must be overcome for this gap to be closed namely funding, marketing and logistics in that order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Funding is required for especially securing an appropriate venue (which with the very few venues available comes at a premium) and is often beyond the financial reach of the organisers if they are individuals. Securing funding requires having the right value proposition and even then, multi-year funding contracts are hard to come by. One reason for this is the lack of track record for new events and their organisers which is what event funders rely on when placing their bets. Also, the inability to reasonably de-risk the uncertainty that surrounds the annual continuity of events has not helped event planners in their quest for funding. Faced with this funding challenge, rather than kill their events, organisers sometimes settle for a smaller version and grow it until sponsors or funders come in. The more successful funding model appears to be the direct ownership of events by corporate organisations who have it as a business plan and provide the staying power to make it an annual mega event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The impact of a good marketing program on the success of an event cannot be underestimated as this is what drives the awareness of the event and determines overall attendance particularly in the first year of the event. While adequate funding helps in driving the marketing campaign, it is the right strategy that maximizes its effect on the marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With funding and marketing in place, an event&rsquo;s moment of truth really lies in the adequacy and efficiency of its logistics plan. It is in the execution of the event logistics that the experience of the event is delivered to the audience. The adequacy of the lighting, sound, booths, conveniences and the smooth running of the event are all test the event logistics plan. Logistics determines whether the event will deliver a return on its investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The bigger the event, the higher the degree of difficulty in putting together these three elements, funding, marketing and logistics. Unlike a musical event where all can be forgiven based on strength of the star musician&rsquo;s performance, every visitor and exhibitor is a star in their own right in an event and the overall impression, therefore, matters a great deal. The larger the number of sponsors, visitors, and exhibitors who carry away the right buzz from an event, the brighter the future of that event. The scarcity of funding, venues and number of properly skilled event planners and volunteers suggest that we are still some way off the barrage of expected events annually. But on the strength of this beginning, a growth industry is evolving and at a fast pace too. Watch this space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

            "slug": "elon-musk-by-ashlee-vance",
            "body": "<p>Tech Entrepreneur, Space Entrepreneur, Solar Entrepreneur, Electric Car Entrepreneur, Digital Payment Entrepreneur. Of the many words that can be used to describe Elon Musk, media shy is certainly an unusual one. But that is exactly what this book on him pitches at the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Author, Ashlee Vance begins his book, which is actually titled &ldquo;Elon Musk&rdquo;, by describing his determination to write the book which is about Elon Musk with or without the co-operation of Elon Musk, whom on account of his dislike for the media didn&rsquo;t want to speak to him and contribute to the book. Fortunately, Mr. Musk changed his mind and the reader is better for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to pin point why exactly you should buy this book because there are just so many reasons why you should want to buy it. Some reasons include the attempt to reconcile the image of the often-erratic person as reported in the press, to that of the Mars colonisation seeking space entrepreneur, the electric car champion and the alumni of the famous PayPal gang that defined Silicon Valley.&nbsp; There are really many things to find out about Elon Musk and for the greater part the book narrates them in some detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does one person manage an electric car company, a rocket company and a solar power company simultaneously? What kind of people work at his companies?&nbsp; Fortunately, of Musk&rsquo;s infamous management style and his recruitment style there is plenty to read about, especially on people management. To hang around his companies for any length of time requires much more than desire, like him you have to be on a mission to something greater than yourself. By the time the Falcon 1 Rocket finally launched four and a half years behind schedule we are told that nearly five hundred people are reported to have worked in Space X, Mr. Musk&rsquo;s space company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those intrigued by his accomplishment and there are several of them, the book recounts Mr. Musk&rsquo;s well-known penchant for setting audacious timelines for the delivery of his projects and meeting them, even if behind schedule. It equally tells about the impact of those goals on people around him including his family. The book confirms what we perhaps already knew from his public profile, which is that determination is one quality not lacking in Elon Musk. It is also refreshing to read about his humanity which like his other endeavors can sometimes be unpredictable. Who would be responsible for sending the first private space craft into space and not shed a tear when it happens? Yes, Musk does cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Musk&rsquo;s person, his achievements, the challenges on the road to those achievements and the simple language in which the book is written makes it difficult to put the book down once you get into it. It may be a biography, but the complex character of the subject gives the book a passage into the realms of being called a management book as well.</p>",

            "body": "<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">Silverbird Small Business Events Circuit: A Game Changer For Small Businesses</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">By all accounts this is probably the best time in recent history to be a small business owner in Nigeria. A growing willingness of private equity providers to invest in small businesses coupled with several sovereign intervention programs through government owned agencies such as the Bank of Industry and more recently single digit interest rate long tenured loans. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">Some calculations even reckon that the recent directive from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to Nigerian banks to maintain a minimum Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 60% could release anywhere in excess of three trillion Naira for lending to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">The intent and message is clear, to grow small business and consumer lending, now!!! The reason is simple, small businesses are not only drivers of economic growth, but also the highest employer of labour when aggregated.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">However while the availability of money for small business owners is being resolved, the greater challenge lies in their inability to access these funds. Money is not free, it has a cost and conditions to accessing it. The individuals need to be ready and their ideas bankable.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">On present evidence, not many small businesses possess the capacity to&nbsp; overcome the obstacles to accessing these funds, at least not in their present shape or form. A lot of effort is still required in equipping small businesses with the tools and skills they need to access these funds. Ranging from training in finance, management and marketing to exposure to markets and customers. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">This is where the approach of Silverbird Entertainment Limited and its partners, Business Day and Eventstracer in launching the Silverbird Small Business Events Circuit qualifies as game changing. While there is no shortage of business events to attend, this particular one is different.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">The Circuit is a combination of calendered sector specific small business events and seminars stretched out over an almost year long period. It is designed to promote the stability and growth of SMEs in Nigeria using a six pillar strategy called CHITTA (Capital, Health, Insurance, Technology, Training and Awareness). &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">CHITTA captures the most urgent challenges that small businesses face and the Circuit provides a platform for over 150,000 visitors and 200 exhibitors from 9 industries to interact over 8 months in the hope of providing solutions to CHITTA. The goal here is to promote greater the interaction to find solutions which can then be used to improve everyone&rsquo;s revenue. This is why the Circuit has the theme Interact, Sell More. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">Another aspect in which the Silverbird Small Business Events Circuit stands out as a game changer is the quality and intent of the partnerships driving the Circuit. First is the experience of its Convener, Silverbird Entertainment Limited, a name renowned for its innovation and pioneering status in Nigeria&rsquo;s entertainment industry.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">It surely must please many watchers that Silverbird is committing its extensive media and real estate assets (especially the Galleria) to the development of Nigerian small businesses by promoting business events for them.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">Business Day is another partner in the Circuit who despite being already firmly established in the world of corporate reportage, still considers the growth of small business sufficiently significant enough to support them with its resources. For Nigeria&rsquo;s leading business daily, to devote its resources to the development of small businesses is more than a gesture, it is s statement of intent and a pointer to where the future lies.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">Signing on the third partner, eventstracer, a digital events platform, is both a tacit positive nod that the future is digital and the recognition of the younger demographic and tech savvy&nbsp; profile of small business owners as exhibitors and visitors to the Circuit.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">The third game changing benefit of the Circuit is the diversity of sectors it has reached into to create the Circuit events. Take for instance the Lagos Flower Convention which is the first of its kind in Nigeria. Horticulture is a growing industry globally and several small business in Nigeria are involved in it. But somehow it has never been on the radar for development despite the growing consumption of the services of florist. Not anymore. The Circuit will change the horticulture industry forever after the Lagos Flower Convention</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">We may yet all find out that this event, the Lagos Flower Convention, has awoken a sleeping economic and commercial giant. The same can be said of the Leather Fashion as well as the Pearls and Beads events which are all part of the Circuit.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">The Circuit approach to eventing is in its own self a game changer. For long, events have mostly been organised spontaneously with little regard for any calendered format. But this is different. The idea that exhibitors, sponsors, visitors and other event stakeholders can know well in advance which events are coming up, will provide them with the opportunity to plan ahead with certainty. The obvious result of this is better planned events that deliver memorable experiences to all participants.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">Examining the various aspects in which the Silverbird Small Business Event Circuit is changing the small business ecosystem will not be complete if the Silverbird SME Award Night is not mentioned. It is the jewel in the crown, the Circuit ending activity that recognizes the best performing small businesses that participated in the Circuit. This has never been done before at previous business events and is directly aimed at motivating small business participating in the Circuit to work to their potentials.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\">While there may yet be other game changing elements embedded in the Circuit, the hope is that even if only those mentioned above are executed perfectly, their impact on small business will be quite significant.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>",

            "slug": "understanding-over-the-top-ott-video-and-tv-revenue-models",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">OTT encompasses the distribution of video content &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo; of traditional distribution technologies. OTT is the delivery of video content through fixed or mobile broadband internet connections instead of over the broadcast TV spectrum or dedicated cable, firbre or satellite networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">OTT is increasingly the preferred method of choice for new players entering in to the broadcast TV and video delivery industry and is responsible for the rise and rise of companies like Netflix into global media power houses. Other notable tech giants in the OTT business include Google with its YouTube Services, Apple with its iTunes, Amazon and to an extent Facebook and Twitter. In 2019 Disney will also launch its own OTT services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">But what is it about OTT, that has reshaped the broadcast and video distribution industry? Flexibility. OTT offers consumers a lot of flexibility in terms of available volume of content, the range of service offerings into which the content can be packaged and the price points at which content consumers can be charged for providing them with OTT services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is now something of a clich&eacute; to say that technology has disrupted traditional broadcast television and filmed entertainment industry, but thanks to the internet and OTT, it has. In the process, the broadcast industry&rsquo;s revenue model (the last mile distribution of television and video to the final consumer) has been transformed. The key to these changes and the emergence of retail content delivery revenue models, is the concept of video-on-demand (VOD) which allows consumers watch video and TV content when, where and how they want to. There are three principal business models through which VOD generates revenue for its providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Advertising Revenue Based Video-on-Demand (AVOD)<br />\r\nThe AVOD revenue model allows consumers gain access to huge libraries of content. Under this arrangement content and other costs are offset by advertising revenues. There are no time limits on access to the content. YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are examples of platforms that offer this model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Transaction Revenue Based Video-on-Demand (TVOD)<br />\r\nThis is a time limit-based OTT revenue approach where the content consumer could either own or rent the content for a one-time fee. The video content can be downloaded and stored on the user&rsquo;s hardware and viewed at any time during the rental period or life time ownership. A good example of an OTT provider that utilises this revenue model is Apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Subscription Revenue Based Video-on-Demand (SVOD)<br />\r\nUnder the SVOD model, consumers pay a monthly fee to access content on the provider&rsquo;s platform. The content is usually distributed via streaming and requires an active online connection. OTT providers in this category include Netflix and Amazon Prime. Netflix has also commenced a service that allows subscribers to download content on their hardware and watch offline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">By disrupting traditional linear television scheduling in which TV companies set the time of viewing, OTT has provided further flexibility with regards to the time, place and the mode through which audiences can consume content. This is something which traditional over-the-air, cable or satellite distribution cannot offer. These developments have changed the media industry&rsquo;s costs and revenue models by making TV and video consumption a retail rather than a corporate business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Though OTT is presently more of an evolution than a revolution, its pace of adoption of by content consumers is likely to quicken as global internet penetration rises and internet speeds increase. This process will also be supported by the army of content providers that are migrating from the amateur ranks into the professional ranks of content production as good quality video and TV content becomes a priceless commodity. OTTs unique ability to aid creativity in service packaging can only lead to additional revenue models which will further drive the industry&rsquo;s growth and attract more players in time to come.</p>",

            "title": "How Bank Guarantees (BGs) Can Help Unlock Collateral And Working Capital",
            "slug": "how-bank-guarantees-bgs-can-help-unlock-collateral-and-working-capital",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A perennial challenge for any small business, even when they have a blue chip contract to execute, is finding the capital with which to finance the contract. Having maxed out on, or failed to secure any borrowings from friends and family often leads small business to the lender&rsquo;s shop for a loan. Notably, the first stop is usually the bank, believing that a good business opportunity is all it takes to gain access to the bank&rsquo;s vault. Lacking the collateral to secure the loan, even when the cash flow looks promising, leads to a failure of the loan application and inevitably anger, towards the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Banks sell a variety of loan products but near certainty of cash flow and collateral are two major keys among others, needed to successfully access any of these products. Interestingly there are some products sold by banks that can help meet both these needs simultaneously. A Bank Guarantee is one of such products.<br />\r\nA Bank Guarantee (popularly called &ldquo;BG&rdquo;) is an assured promise provided by a bank, on behalf of its customer, to its customer&rsquo;s supplier (counterparty) effectively undertaking to pay the counterparty an agreed contractual amount upon the satisfactory delivery of the agreed service or product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">BGs have long been a major financing tool for commercial companies, especially in the construction, real estate, oil and gas and general contracting businesses. A simple example illustrates how a BG simultaneously solves the twin challenges of collateral and near certainty of cash flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>An Example</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">XYZ Limited has won an above average sized contract from a large company ABC Limited to supply the quarterly provisions required by its catering department. But ABC will only pay XYZ after the goods have been supplied and certified appropriate as per the purchase order. XYZ Limited neither has the independent capital to fund the supply nor suitable collateral with which to borrow money from a bank to enable it finance the contract. A request by XYZ for an advance payment was turned down by ABC who is, however, willing to issue XYZ with a Bank Guarantee from its banker for eventual payment, alongside the local purchase order given to it. Armed with this BG, XYZ walks into its bank and asks its bank to advance it a percentage of the total value of the BG to enable it to execute the supply and the bank grants its request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Resolving the Collateral Issue</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">XYZ receives the financing it needs because the issuance of the BG has transformed the contract into an interbank transaction where the promise to pay is no longer between one company to another, but now rather between banks. ABC&rsquo;s bank has issued the Bank Guarantee on behalf of ABC Limited because it knows that ABC has in place the money with which to pay XYZ at the completion of the contract between ABC and XYZ. XYZ&rsquo;s bank knows that as a bank, ABC&rsquo;s bank will keep its promise to transfer the money to XYZ&rsquo;s account once the contract is satisfactorily completed. This promise by ABC&rsquo;s bank as represented by the BG resolves the collateral issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Resolving the Working Capital Issue</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The BG also has a face value equal to the value of the contract being financed and by going to their bank, XYZ is attempting to realise a percentage of that face value for cash (this is called BG Discounting) and by so doing accesses the working capital it needs to execute the contract and get paid for it. As part of the process of ensuring that the contract is fulfilled according to its terms, XYZ&rsquo;s bank will create some conditions which XYZ must meet before releasing the funds. It could, for instance, insist on the appointment of an agent to monitor the entire purchase and delivery process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Of course, the value of the transaction must be commercially viable to XYZ&rsquo;s bank before it commits resources to it. It is important to note that an interest will be charged on the funds provided to XYZ in the discounting process and this interest payment will continue until ABC makes payment for the fully executed contract. The percentage of the value of the contract made available to XYZ through the discounting process will normally be such that its interest and principal repayment does not jeopardise the entire contract value. However not all BG transactions require funds to be disbursed and where this is the case, fees and not interest is charged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As small business expand, it is inevitable that they will require additional working capital, and understanding how Bank Guarantees can help them achieve this goal is critical to their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>",

            "title": "Private Equity Heavyweights Gather As Lagos Based Law Firm, Duale, Ovia & Alex-Adedipe (DOA) Holds Inagural Business Series On Telecommunications, Media & Technology",
            "slug": "private-equity-heavyweights-gather-as-lagos-based-law-firm-duale-ovia-alex-adedipe-doa-holds-inagural-business-series-on-telecommunications-media-technology",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For nearly a decade now the impact of rapid developments in technology has blurred the lines separating otherwise independent industries and none so much as the media and telecommunications industry. This trend has created and is still creating several opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors alike. To this extent, it&rsquo;s now almost impossible to answer the question about whether Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FAANG as they are now referred to) are media or technology companies. What about their Asian counterparts, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT as they are also now called), are they technology or payment system companies?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Not even the old world has been spared from the disruption of technologically enabled media convergence. Why else would AT&amp;T want to purchase Time Warner or Verizon purchase both AOL and Yahoo? Ultimately, perhaps the greatest technological agent of change and opportunity in equal measure in our time is the mobile Smart Phone and mobile technology. They jointly represent the medium through which technology has broken through the dividing line between media and telecommunications. Taking advantage of the opportunities that this disruption of business as usual presents requires capital, huge amounts of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perhaps it is against this backdrop that the partners at Lagos based law firm Duale, Ovia &amp; Alex-Adedipe felt it was time to intermediate in the Nigerian media technology environment by bringing together, in one room, the industry&rsquo;s opportunists and the fund providers to begin this engagement process. The venue for the conference was the luxury Wheatbaker Hotel located in the highbrow Ikoyi area in Lagos with its theme as Investment in Nigeria&rsquo;s Telecommunication, Media and Technology (TMT) market. In attendance where four categories of people. The first group consists some of the earliest stewards of Nigeria&rsquo;s telecommunication landscape represented by the distinguished person of Mr. Gbenga Oyebode, MFR.&nbsp; The second category of people in attendance was the investor group and it was easy enough to recognise Dr. Akintoye Akindele of Synergy Capital among them. The third group could be described as beneficiaries of private equity investments in their individual businesses of which Obinna Okezie of Wakanow was a known face. The fourth category in attendance were persons seeking funding as well as general participants. In all, it was a packed house to say the least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From the opening address by Adeniyi Duale, Managing Partner, DOA, it was apparent that the conference audience was in for some serious stuff. The intent of the speech highlighted the challenges of the rapid rate of change going on presently in TMT, the investment challenge of keeping up with this rate of change, TMT&rsquo;s infrastructure deficit, its opportunities and the challenge of both funding that deficit and the right opportunities simultaneously. In the light of these challenges, leadership needed to emerge to lead in the discussions in finding and defining an investment framework for Nigeria&rsquo;s TMT space. By organizing this conference, it appears that DOA is a strong part of that required leadership. In his keynote address, Mr. Gbenga Oyebode, MFR reminded the audience about how Nigeria&rsquo;s telecommunication industry was founded and its evolution since that time from simply providing voice services to the digital platforms (that now provide value-added services like payment systems and other data services) that telcos have now become. Many of these, he added were not envisaged in the pioneering days. He seemed in moments to challenge the conference to find the right funding framework for the opportunities that are emerging in Nigeria&rsquo;s TMT industry and rightly so too given the industry&rsquo;s capital guzzling capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Starting off the panel discussions, Dr. Akintoye Akindele stated that with the way the industry is evolving, his firm Synergy Capital has added Payment Systems to TMT and urged that the discussions revolve around the broader TMTP base. From a fund provider perspective, he shed light on the pre-funding requirements of private equity investors and some of the failings of small business owners who have sought funds from private equity firms.&nbsp; His panelists which included Obinna Okezie of Wakanow, Adekunbi Ademiluyi of Netplus and Sadiq Abu of Barclays Nigeria shared their individual experiences on the fund-raising circuit. The second session which was chaired by Eghosa Omoigui, followed immediately after and its panelists included Mrs. Olayinka David-West of Lagos Business School and Dele Adeyinka of Wema Bank Plc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A major difficulty with providing the TMTP industry with the investment it needs is how to best determine its financial indices such as capital expenditure requirements and projected revenue and profits in a fast-changing environment. While this is relatively straightforward for the telcos and payment system providers, it not the same for the media players whose revenues continue to experience segmentation across its various traditional and digital platforms. What is not in doubt though is the fact that the company&rsquo;s playing in the TMTP sector absorb investment like no other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">According to estimates compiled by VWS, the telecom industry recorded operating expense of N466.9bn in 2016 and interest expense of N252bn. Within the same period, long-term assets had a value of N1.2tr and interest-bearing liabilities closed at N1.48tr. Financial data made available by MTN, the largest player in the sector show that capital expenditure in 2016 was N196bn (an under investment due to unavailability of FCY) up from N130bn in 2015. By 2017 this figure had increased to N225bn. For comparison, even Google spooked the financial markets with its $6bn capital expenditure in the quarter ended March 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Through whichever lens you choose to look at them, these are huge numbers and a capital structure supported by debt funding alone would put the industry in reasonable financial difficulty. And as Mr. Oyebode pointed out in his address, the behemoths of today didn&rsquo;t know it would evolve to this level when they started business back in the day. It is therefore important to get funding right, from the start. If only for this reason, the DOA conference was timely and there should be more of its kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Of course, all the investment challenges around the TMT space cannot be resolved in one day or even at one conference. But, if what DOA has done with this Inaugural Business Series is anything to go by, the industry is positioning its self perfectly to reap the benefits of a well-developed investment framework to harvest its opportunities and provide returns to its investors. It is fair to assume that the audience awaits the next calling from DOA.</p>",

            "title": "Synergy Capital Partner, DR. Akintoye Akindele, Lists 4 Questions To Answer Before Seeking Private Equity Funding",
            "slug": "synergy-capital-partner-dr-akintoye-akindele-lists-4-questions-to-answer-before-seeking-private-equity-funding",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">He is undoubtedly one of the better-known faces and leading lights in Nigeria&rsquo;s private equity industry. So, when Dr. Akintoye Akindele, a Partner at private equity firm Synergy Capital speaks everyone, especially small businesses seeking funds to scale up their processes, listens. Chairing one of the sessions at the Duale, Ovia &amp; Alex-Adedipe (DOA) Inaugural Business Series, Dr. Akintoye took time out to highlight several gaps (and how to bridge those gaps) in the current pitch to private equity investors by most small business owners. The conference had as its theme Investment in Nigeria&rsquo;s Telecommunications, Media and Technology Market (TMT).&nbsp;=&rdquo;1&Prime;}</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With over USD 500m worth of investments under the management of his firm Synergy Capital and a decent percentage of it in TMT, Dr. Akintoye had the benefit of experience to back his advice. In his opening comments, he quickly added Payments to the TMT acronym making it Telecommunications, Media, Technology and Payments (TMTP). In his view, there are four questions to be answered by any business owner seeking funding from private equity investors and these questions are;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">1. What is the commerce behind the idea?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">2. What is the business model to exploit the commerce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">3. What is the capital structure for the commerce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">4. What is the investor return?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">He continued by detailing how unaware of these questions a lot of small business owners are when they go seeking for capital to scale up their businesses. As a result, only very, few of them get beyond this first stage of questioning more out of not being prepared for it than anything else. He cautioned that the private equity investment process is rigorous and can be lengthy depending on the nature of the business and its complexity but with proper advisory services to hand hold the business owner these hurdles can be scaled as indeed many have. He also added that among other things, the private equity investors would also want to know exactly what activity it is that the business does, why that activity is relevant, why the private equity investor should care about it and where ultimately the business is going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Speaking to the packed audience that had gathered for the conference at the Wheatbaker Hotel in Ikoyi, Lagos, Dr. Akintoye mentioned execution and growth as two critical things that investors look out for while considering whether to make an investment or not. Execution, he said, answers the people question in the business which is, who are they? What is their track record and what is their capacity for implement the business goals successfully? While growth relates to the nature of the market that the business serves and answers the scalability question, is the business scalable? Taken together a positive response to these questions by the small business firm is a huge step towards successful fundraising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before closing the session, the Synergy Capital Partner explained briefly the literal difference between a Series A and Series B funding rounds in private equity parlance. He remarked that in a Series A funding round, the business owner is simply selling a story, a vision of the future. In a Series B funding round, it is a reality that is being sold as per what did you achieve with your Series A funding?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">He took some time out to also respond to the often-asked questions of why the returns cycle of private equity funds in Nigeria is shorter than what obtains in the European and US markets. According to him the average age of the Nigerian entrepreneur is much higher than that of his European or US counterpart many of whom launch their businesses while still in school as opposed to Nigeria&rsquo;s late-stage entrepreneurial situation. In addition, he posited that Nigeria not only came late to the private equity party but did so with an overdose of historical debt lending background driven by the safety net of collateral and as a result, the country&rsquo;s private equity industry is still developing the financing know-how for early-stage businesses.</p>",

            "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Coming 2018/19 N500B Media Spend Cycle: A VWS Analysis",
            "slug": "nigerias-coming-201819-n500b-media-spend-cycle-a-vws-analysis",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After two difficult years, Nigeria&rsquo;s media industry is set to kick into high gears as it begins a 9 month long four yearly spending cycle, first with the FIFA Football World Cup in early June and then shortly after that the electioneering campaigns for various positions at federal and state levels. Both events combined, have a significant impact on the bottom line of every serious player in the media industry including newspapers, radio and TV stations, out-of-home advertisers, event planners, graphics printers and online portals. VWS research data estimates that in each of the years that these events occur, they help raise media industry revenue by as much as 11%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Coming off the back of a 2-year recession, this spending cycle is most welcome. With Nigeria playing in the 2018 World Cup and expectations of fiercely contested elections, media industry revenue is well set up for good times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">But this cycle promises to be different as the upside to revenue may be much more than previously known, especially with regards to election advertising revenue. With a much faster and higher rate of internet penetration due to lower priced data packages, there has been an enhanced mass adoption of social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and their likes. It will be the first election since this mass adoption began and it will no doubt play a key role in the advertising program of various campaigns as these platforms offer several advantages over traditional media advertising. For instance, Social media advertising campaigns store for much longer than on traditional media, their trending nature help them reach more audiences, they cost less to create, they are more flexible (can be run multiple times in different variations) and perhaps, more importantly, can be used right up the election day. With the role of Facebook in the US elections now common knowledge who would bet against its extensive use in every other election?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Of a certainty, between June 2018 and March 2019, media spend in Nigeria is expected to turbocharge. Here, VWS examines the expected revenue growth in the industry&rsquo;s various sub-sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Television</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;According to PWC Media Industry report and projections made by VWS, stable growth is expected to return to TV advertising for the first time since 2016 when it grew by less than 1% to N91billion for the first time in nearly a decade. Unadjusted for inflation and exchange rate movement since 2016, TV advertising revenue will exceed N100billion in 2018 driven by the increased number of TV stations available and the earlier than normal scheduled date for elections. This is a 7.5% increase over TV advertising revenue of N93b in 2017.&nbsp; Revenue is expected to grow an additional 3% in 2019 to N103b.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Radio</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ever the cheaper alternative to TV advertising, annual revenue growth in radio advertising was also affected by the recession of 2016 and 2017. However, it rebounded in 2017 with revenues of N18billion representing a growth of 6.9% over the N17.6billion of 2016. Driven by mobile phone adoption (mobile phones now come with radios), radio as a medium has a population penetration rate of over 80% in Nigeria. As audience have segmented, several new radio stations have opened up across the country to serve these segmented audiences and advertising revenue will also grow along these lines. VWS projects an increase in radio advertising revenue of 11% to N20.1billion in 2018 and 9% in 2019 to N23.8billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>NewsPapers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Under pressure from the growth of digital as a news media platform and also the growth of specialist sport daily newspapers,&nbsp; penetration levels for national and regional print media in Nigeria have dropped from 30% in 2015 to 24% in 2017 but could tick back up, to 25%&nbsp; by the end of 2019 after this media spend cycle.&nbsp; The good news is that print newspapers have retained their position as an integral part of the reading experience of Nigerian elites and continues to be influential which has enabled it marginally grow its readership annually in that segment. Newspaper circulation growth numbers for the top seven national and regional newspapers have been flat, recording figures of 160, 000 in 2017, a 6.33% growth which should inch upwards to 173, 000 in 2018 and 180, 000 in 2019, showing 8% and 4.1% growth respectively. Using the same top-selling newspapers as an industry proxy, advertising revenue is expected to grow by 10.9% to N31.4billion in 2018 before moderating to N34.16billion with an 8% growth in 2019. This growth will occur on the strength of increases in the aggregate number newspaper advertising pages from 175 pages in 2017 to 195 in 2019 priced at an average of N480, 000 per page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Outdoor Physical Bill Boards / Posters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Though it has the highest national audience penetration level (75% plus) behind radio,&nbsp; the growth of digital billboards and increased regulatory oversight, especially in a key market like Lagos, has sent the market for physical billboards and posters into decline. It still is an extremely strong channel in the suburban and rural markets where its consumption is driving the sub sector&rsquo;s decreasing marginal growth of 2.1% and 1.4% respectively for 2018 and 2019 according to PWC&rsquo;s media report. Nevertheless, this growth corresponds to N43b and 44billion in revenue which makes it a much larger revenue earner than both the radio and newspaper markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Digital Bill Boards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is an emerging market with a phenomenal revenue growth rate that approaches 50%. Its flexibility will help drive revenue during this spending cycle especially from the World Cup as it becomes a veritable source of news on the go in traffic and malls. Revenue in 2017 is estimated by PWC to reach N4.5b in 2018 and N6.4m in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Digital Media: Web, Mobile &amp; SMS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With internet penetration in Nigeria now in excess of 50%, the 2018/19 spending cycle will mark the coming of age of the web, mobile and SMS as the new media heavyweights in Nigeria&rsquo;s advertising landscape. Existing media consumption habits suggest that while the web advertising will be driven by online news sites, video sites and blogs, mobile media will be driven by social media giants like Facebook, opinion boards like Twitter and messaging platforms like Whatsapp, Instagram and Snap Chat. Across all these platforms, video creation will play a key role in audience engagement which will in turn drive advertising. This will perhaps be the first fully video-driven media spend cycle in Nigeria. VWS data indicates that in this media spending season web, mobile and SMS advertising revenue will reach N50billion surpassing the N34.16billion expected from print advertising. This revenue is directly related not only the speed and efficiency of the trio of the web, mobile, and SMS in reaching and engaging their audience but also how the bite-size pricing of the service makes it possible to reach these audiences several times over at less the cost of traditional media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Aggregate Revenue Size</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Fueled by the growth in digital media spend, aggregate revenue during this media spend cycle is expected to grow 15% from N203billion in 2017 to N239billion in 2018. By the end of the spend cycle in 2019, industry revenue would have reached N261billion representing a 10% increase. The implication here is that between 2018 and 2019 a combined revenue of N500billion would have been earned by different players in the Nigerian media space. There are significant opportunities here for small media business to benefit from this golden season in the media industry. As audiences increasingly segment, as new technology reduce entry barriers to media, as content creation becomes more accommodating for amateurs alongside professionals, and as media consumption habits become more defined by the on-demand and sharing economy, there couldn&rsquo;t be a better time for small media businesses in Nigeria to thrive.&nbsp; The key question then, is how do small media businesses position themselves to benefit from the media economy at this time? Stay with VWS as we point the way forward in a series of articles on the Nigerian media economy.</p>",

            "slug": "4-things-to-be-aware-of-before-starting-a-school",
            "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With a generally agreed population estimate of 200m people and an annual population growth rate that is nearer to 2%, education is undoubtedly a growth sector in the Nigerian economy and will remain so for a long while. Nigeria&rsquo;s population distribution, according to data from the CIA World Fact Book, shows that 52.44% (104m) of the population are aged 19 years or below. To think that this distribution numbers represent only the pre-school to high school age and excludes the tertiary education age group provides an indication as to the size of Nigeria&rsquo;s education industry.&nbsp;This report is focused on the pre-tertiary level schooling population which accounts for most school startups. This report is focused on the pre-tertiary level schooling population which accounts for most school startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There is a constant need in the economy to keep expanding educational infrastructure across all levels, pre-school, primary, secondary and tertiary levels in order to keep up with the demand for educational services by the population. It is of little surprise then that establishing a school ranks high on the start-up list of many would be entrepreneurs as the market gap for educational services is all too glaring. Moreover, starting a school is regarded as the ultimate small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">While the generally often stated goal by education entrepreneurs is usually to improve the standard of education and provide adequate educational infrastructure for the school-age population, one of the key motivations is the perception that schools as a business, are cash cows. While this may be true at some point in the life cycle of a school, it certainly does not start out that way at any level of the schooling experience, even at the pre-school stage. And promoters of schools will need to have run the school for several years, if not across generations before the school can become the cash cow envisaged at its start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Four Overlooked Issues While Starting A School</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Several, if not all school entrepreneurs, have been surprised by four characteristics of the schooling business. The first is that revenues come in only 3 times a year, at the start of the first, second and third terms and this especially hits you hard in the first term of the school as it is not yet at full capacity but expenses are already in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The second, and they are hardly ever prepared for this, is that teachers salaries, electrify and other expenses still have to be paid during the holidays especially the long vacation. This implies that the school management will have to arrange for short-term funding to cope with these period pending when school fees are paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A third characteristic of an early stage school business is that schools require continuous investments sometimes well past their fifth year of existence. This is because they are either expanding facilities to cope with additional students or moving to a permanent site from rented spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The fourth and perhaps most humbling characteristic of schools as a business is that the demand for school services is price elastic and prices can therefore not be randomly increased otherwise enrollment will decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A lack of preparation on the part of several education entrepreneurs on how best to cope with these four characteristics of the education business plays a major role in the potential stagnation, decline or even closure of many schools. So before you step out to launch that new school be sure to have a plan in place to deal with these four realities as having that plan in place could mean the difference between your success and failure.</p>",
